About OpenBSC
=============

OpenBSC is a minimalistic implementation of the GSM Network, with particular
emphasis on the functionality typically provided by the BSC, MSC, HLR, VLR.

Its only current interface is a mISDN based E1 interface utilizing the A-bis
protocol between BSC and BTS.  In other words, you can connect an existing
GSM Base Transceiver Station (BTS) through E1 to OpenBSC.

So far, it has only been tested with the Siemens microBTS BS-11.  Test reports
with other BTS are appreciated!

This project is still in its early days, and there are lots of areas where it
doesn't behave as per GSM spec.
